This is the repo for **Laravel + Vue** pre set-up *scaffolding ?*. This was prepared by the author to save time setting up tiring setup which Laravel requires to work with vue. Made for personal use but feel free to use it as you like. If you think you can improve the code quality or add some features, you're welcome to try ;)
